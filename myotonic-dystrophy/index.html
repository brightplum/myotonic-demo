          <h2>Our Vision</h2>
          <p>We envision a world with treatments and a cure for myotonic dystrophy.</p>
          <h2>Our Mission</h2>
          <p>The mission of the Myotonic Dystrophy Foundation is Community, Care, and a Cure.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>We support and connect the myotonic dystrophy community.</li>
            <li>We provide resources and advocate for care.</li>
            <li>We accelerate research toward treatments and a cure.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The Myotonic Dystrophy Foundation (MDF) is the leading global advocate helping patients and families navigate the myotonic dystrophy (DM) disease process, and is often the first resource contacted by newly-diagnosed patients, their families, their social workers and their physicians around the world. For many international patients, the Myotonic Dystrophy Foundation is often the only resource they are able to locate, and MDF has provided assistance and support for people living with DM in more than 139 countries around the world.
            Currently tens of thousands of people living with myotonic dystrophy, their families & friends make up the Myotonic Dystrophy Foundation community.</p>
          <h2>Our 2021-2024 Strategic Plan</h2>
          <p>On December 14, 2021 the MDF Board of Directors approved the 2021-2024 Strategic Plan. The plan introduces MDF’s updated Mission and Vision, our new Values, and the four key goal areas designed to help us strengthen our community, improve access to effective healthcare that meets the needs of individuals and families, eliminate barriers to drug development, and continue to build a strong and sustainable organization. Click here to learn more about our process and to view the plan!</p>
          <h2>Our Background</h2>
          <p>We created the Myotonic Dystrophy Foundation to enhance the quality of life of people living with myotonic dystrophy and to drive research focused on treatments and a cure. DM is an inherited disorder that can appear at any age and manifests differently in every person. There is currently no treatment or cure.</p>

Click on the links below and to the right to learn more about the clinical trials process, important do's and don'ts for current trial participants, and more. A list of current studies and trials can be accessed below.</p>
              <p>Myotonic Dystrophy Foundation community members have been active partners in bringing the research to this point, by supporting and participating in studies, joining registries, responding to surveys, and funding patient advocacy organizations like the MDF. The progress achieved would not be possible without the commitment and participation of people living with DM, their families, caregivers and friends.</p>

              <p>Raising awareness of myotonic dystrophy will help improve service provision, basic research, drug development, and policymaking related to the disease. Increased funding for myotonic dystrophy research will improve health outcomes, reduce disability, and increase life expectancy for individuals living with the disease, and holds great promise for helping individuals with diseases with similar genetic bases, such as Fragile X syndrome and Huntington's disease.</p>

              <p>Please know that the use of anesthesia raises special risks to those living with myotonic dystrophy (DM), as the disease results in heightened sensitivity to sedatives and analgesics. Pay particular attention to the serious complications that can arise in the post-anesthesia period, when risk of aspiration and other complications increase.</p>
              <p>MDF has published two versions of its Anesthesia Guidelines: A one-page summary of the anesthesia guidelines to share with your clinician and anesthesiologist. The complete "Practical Suggestions for the Anesthetic Management of a Myotonic Dystrophy Patient".</p>

              <h5>How Myotonic Dystrophy Affects Your Body</h5>
              <p>Myotonic dystrophy (DM) can affect all age groups, and people living with DM often have different symptoms at different ranges of severity. DM can also affect a range of systems, so symptom management requires a more expansive approach. You’ll likely need to coordinate with a multidisciplinary team to provide comprehensive care. Here's an article that shows the range of specialists you might work with, and what they're focus will be.</p>
